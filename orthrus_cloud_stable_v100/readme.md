Here is the collection of three Colab notebooks:
1. pridepy_for_raw.ipynb - for fetching .raw data from PRIDE
2. mono_ThermoRawFileParser.ipynb - for converting .raw to .mzML/.mgf
3. orthrus_stable_v100_main.ipynb - walking Orthrus from de novo sequencing (Casanovo) to database searching + rescoring (Sage + Mokapot)

Library versions are pinned for stability. Colab runtime will automatically restart to refresh the environment and prevent version conflicts.
